# **Statistical Analysis in Python on Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**

## **Introduction**
Sleep is a crucial component of overall health, and various lifestyle factors can significantly impact sleep quality and duration. This project aims to analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset using Python to explore these relationships. Through statistical analysis, we seek to understand how habits such as exercise, diet, and screen time correlate with sleep patterns. The findings could offer valuable insights into improving sleep health and general well-being.

## **Instructions**
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Required Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will ensure that all required packages are installed and up-to-date.

2. **Run the Analysis:**
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells sequentially. Each cell performs specific tasks such as data loading, cleaning, visualization, and modeling.

## **Description**
The Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset provides a comprehensive overview of individuals' sleep habits alongside their lifestyle choices. This project analyzes the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between variables such as:

- **Sleep Duration:** The number of hours slept per night.
- **Exercise Frequency:** The number of days per week an individual engages in physical activity.
- **Diet Quality:** An assessment of the nutritional value of the individual's diet.
- **Screen Time:** The amount of time spent on electronic devices before bed.

### **Key Analytical Steps:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data to understand distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Statistical Testing:** Applying tests like t-tests, ANOVA, and correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between variables.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to predict sleep quality based on lifestyle factors.

The insights derived from this analysis can be valuable for making informed lifestyle adjustments to improve sleep health.

## **Requirements**
To run this project, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For running and interacting with the notebook. Install via Anaconda or using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
- **Required Python Libraries:** The analysis relies on several Python libraries, all of which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn
 
- ## Conclusion
    Through the analysis of the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset, we aim to uncover meaningful relationships between sleep quality and various lifestyle factors. By understanding these relationships, individuals 
    can make informed decisions to enhance their sleep health and overall well-being. The findings from this project could also inform public health recommendations and contribute to the development of 
    personalized lifestyle interventions for better sleep outcomes.
